## Senior Software Engineering Manager → Aspiring Head of Engineering/Digital

Platform engineering leader transitioning to strategic executive roles, bringing operational excellence, strategic thinking, and proven capability to maximize impact with lean teams.

## Executive Summary

I lead platform engineering teams that serve as critical infrastructure enabling organization-wide success. Currently leading a strategic rebranding initiative involving 50 components and 460+ pages across the next two quarters. With a **100% team retention rate** across 2 teams (8 engineers), I maintain operational excellence through SLAs/SLOs and minimal incident rates. My platform services enable **15+ teams** as critical dependencies, positioning us as the foundational infrastructure where others stand.

Built over 20 years of progressive technical and leadership experience, my deep technical foundation now informs strategic business decisions rather than hands-on coding. I deliver results with resource-efficient teams—proven even with teams as lean as 2 engineers—while continuously developing through strategic learning (13 management books in recent years) and proactive managing up.

## Strategic Impact

**Platform Leadership & Scale:**
- Enabling 15+ teams through critical infrastructure dependencies
- Leading strategic rebranding initiative: 50 components, 460+ pages over 2 quarters

**Operational Excellence:**
- **100% team retention rate** across 2 teams (8 engineers) - nobody has quit under my leadership
- Minimal incidents with SLAs/SLOs managed for platform services
- Extensive due diligence and audit work for CMS platform replacement

**Resource Efficiency:**

- Maximum impact with minimal resources, proven strategic capability

**Current Strategic Initiative:**
- Leading company-wide rebranding effort at scale, demonstrating ability to execute large-scale organizational change

## Value Proposition

**Platform Leadership:** I build and maintain critical infrastructure that enables 15+ teams to achieve their goals. While this foundational work may seem less visible, it's essential—we are the giants where others stand.

**Operational Excellence:** I maintain 100% team retention, manage services with SLAs/SLOs, and keep incident rates minimal. Strategic capability demonstrated through extensive due diligence and audit work.

**Strategic Thinking:** My 20-year technical foundation informs platform architecture decisions, risk management, and strategic planning. Combined with continuous learning (13 management books) and proactive managing up, I bring both depth and executive readiness.

**Resource Efficiency:** Proven ability to deliver results with lean teams, maximizing impact through strategic planning, clear communication, and efficient execution.

## Leadership Philosophy

My approach to leadership is grounded in strategic thinking developed over decades. My father taught me chess at age 5-6, and I achieved 3rd place in a school tournament. This early foundation in strategic games—combined with years of PC strategy games and Warhammer—has shaped my systems thinking and long-term planning approach.

This strategic mindset translates directly to organizational leadership:
- **Systems Thinking:** Understanding how individual components create organizational value
- **Long-term Planning:** Building sustainable, scalable engineering organizations rather than reactive management
- **Organizational Design:** Creating structures that enable rather than constrain
- **Continuous Learning:** 13 management books in recent years demonstrate commitment to leadership development

I'm passionate about building inclusive, high-performing teams where engineers, designers, and product teams collaborate effectively. My platform leadership philosophy emphasizes enablement: we don't always have our own direct metrics, but we play a massive role in what others achieve.
